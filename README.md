## Question 1 

For this question, I first ran the shell script to produce the ms_data_dirty.csv so I could determine which columns corresponded with the columns required in the final ms_data.csv file. The columns needed from ms_data_dirty.csv are 1 (patient_id), 2 (visit_id), 4 (age), 5 (education_level), 6 (walking_speed).
